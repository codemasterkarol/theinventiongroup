            <h4>What is an invention license?</h4>
            <p>An invention license allows someone to buy the rights to manufacture and sell your invention for a profit. Once a license is signed, the inventor receives a percentage of the total sales from the manufacturer in the form of a monthly check.</p>

            <p>The license allows you (the inventor) to make money by giving a manufacturer the right to produce and sell your product.</p>
